# Plant Monitor

The Plant Monitor was a project spawned in an entrepreneurship class centered around the internet of things.  It uses a particle photon with a moisture sensor connected to get the moisture level of the plant.  Then using a GET request I get that data from the web interface as well as send out a text message notification if the plant needs to be watered.
